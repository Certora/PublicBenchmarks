# PublicBenchmarks

Public repository of benchmarks that are of interest to Certora

Typically, these are benchmarks produced by Certora's tools, e.g., Certora Prover.

Note that we continually develop our tools, so older benchmarks might be not as relevant to us as newer ones. We usually indicate the (rough) date of benchmark creation in the folder names here.
If you are interested in an up-to-date suite of Certora benchmarks, feel very free to contact us.
